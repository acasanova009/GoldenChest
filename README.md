# GoldenChest
Instead of having many  seeds phrases, this tool will help make a GoldenChest in which you can dumb your seeds. And keep everything safe inside.

How to use

Step 1 - Download page and use offline

Step 2 - Make a text file will of the important stuff

Step 3 - Get a random seed phrase generator or strong password.

Step 4 - Use the Cifrado de Texto (AES-GCM). Save the output. (This is your golden chest)

Step 5 - Split your password with shamir shares. And backthem up. 

Step 6 - Erease the password.

At the end you should have 2 main things.

1 - The Golden Chest. Which is simply a lot of characters and save those in a file.
2 - A bunch of shamir shares. Split them in secure locations.

One great benefit, is for inheritance. You can make a group of shares specifically for you family or loved ones.
And even if you keep on updating the chest (using the same restored password), you wont have to tell them. 
With the original shares they hold, they can still open you chest. If so you chose.
