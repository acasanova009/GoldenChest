--------------------------------------------
At the end you should have 2 main things.
-
1 - The Golden Chest. Which is simply a lot of characters and save those in a file.

2 - A bunch of shamir shares. Split them in secure locations.

One great benefit is for inheritance.
-
You can make a group of shares specifically for you family or loved ones.
And even if you keep on updating the chest (password), you wont have to constantly keep updating them. Becuase their shamir shares can recreate the password.
